### 3. Company Financial History and Detailed Analysis

#### 3.1. Income Statement Analysis (Annual, ending March 31)

Alibaba has demonstrated consistent revenue growth over the past few years, indicating an expanding business despite a slight plateau observed in the latest reported annual data (2024 and 2025 appearing identical suggests the 2025 annual report might not be fully updated, so we primarily analyze trends up to 2024 and use TTM for the most current snapshot).

*   **Revenue:** Grew steadily from $853.06 billion in 2021 to $996.35 billion in 2024. The latest TTM revenue of $1,012.06 billion suggests continued, albeit slower, top-line expansion.
*   **Gross Profit:** Followed a similar upward trend, increasing from $313.61 billion in 2021 to $398.06 billion in 2024. This indicates the company has largely maintained its gross profitability as revenue scaled.
*   **Operating Income:** Showed robust growth, rising from $94.78 billion in 2021 to $147.08 billion in 2024. This signifies improved operational efficiency or leverage.
*   **Net Income (Continuous Operations):** Experienced substantial growth, particularly between 2023 ($71.33 billion) and 2024 ($125.98 billion). This strong increase points to effective cost management or significant one-off gains in 2024. The TTM Net Income of $125.43 billion is consistent with the strong performance in the latest full fiscal year.
*   **Diluted EPS:** Mirroring net income, Diluted EPS surged from $22.72 in 2021 to $53.60 in 2024, indicating increased profitability on a per-share basis. The TTM EPS of $7.61 (from fundamentals) is considerably lower than the 2024 annual EPS of $53.60. This is a critical discrepancy. It's possible the 'EPS (TTM)' from fundamentals uses a different calculation or covers a period where non-recurring gains from 2024 are not included, or recent performance has declined. Traders should investigate this difference closely. The Forward EPS of $8.84 suggests an anticipated improvement from the TTM EPS but still significantly lower than 2024 annual.

#### 3.2. Balance Sheet Analysis (Annual, ending March 31)

Alibaba's balance sheet reflects a strong asset base and manageable debt.

*   **Total Assets:** Consistently grew from $1,695.55 billion in 2021 to $1,804.23 billion in 2024, indicating continuous investment and expansion.
*   **Total Liabilities:** Also increased, from $613.36 billion in 2021 to $714.12 billion in 2024, but at a slower pace than assets, suggesting a healthy capital structure.
*   **Common Stock Equity:** Demonstrated growth from $948.48 billion in 2021 to $1,009.86 billion in 2024, reflecting retained earnings and shareholder value.
*   **Total Debt:** Increased from $176.60 billion in 2021 to $248.11 billion in 2024. Despite the increase, the **Debt to Equity ratio** at 27.25% (TTM) remains relatively low, indicating prudent leverage.
*   **Current Ratio:** Stood at 1.456 (TTM), suggesting good short-term liquidity, as current assets comfortably cover current liabilities.
*   **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments:** Fluctuated, peaking at $571.03 billion in 2023 before declining to $428.09 billion in 2024. This indicates strategic deployment of cash or increased operational needs.

#### 3.3. Cash Flow Statement Analysis (Annual, ending March 31)

Cash flow analysis reveals the company's ability to generate cash from its operations and how it allocates capital.

*   **Operating Cash Flow:** Remained strong but showed a slight decline from a peak of $199.75 billion in 2022 to $163.51 billion in 2024. This is still a substantial amount, indicating healthy core business operations.
*   **Investing Cash Flow:** Consistently negative, reflecting significant investments in growth. It varied considerably, from -$198.59 billion in 2021 to -$21.82 billion in 2023, then back to -$185.42 billion in 2024. This volatility suggests varying levels of acquisition activity or capital expenditures year-to-year.
*   **Financing Cash Flow:** Also consistently negative, indicating the company is repaying debt or repurchasing shares. It ranged from -$64.45 billion in 2021 to -$108.24 billion in 2023, then to -$76.22 billion in 2024.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Showed a declining trend from $165.40 billion in 2022 to $77.54 billion in 2024. The TTM Free Cash Flow reported in fundamentals is -$49.49 billion, a concerning shift to negative. This could be due to increased capital expenditures, changes in working capital, or a decline in operating cash flow in the most recent periods not fully reflected in the annual reports. This needs careful monitoring as sustained negative FCF can impact liquidity and growth funding.

### 4. Key Trends and Insights for Traders

*   **Revenue and Profitability Growth:** Alibaba has shown a consistent upward trend in revenue, gross profit, operating income, and net income through 2024. This indicates a growing core business and improved operational efficiency. The TTM revenue also suggests continued growth.
*   **EPS Discrepancy:** A significant divergence exists between the annual Diluted EPS for 2024 ($53.60) and the TTM EPS ($7.61) from the fundamentals. This warrants further investigation. Traders should understand the reasons behind this difference, which could be related to non-recurring items in the 2024 annual report or a recent downturn in profitability not yet captured in the full annual statements. The lower Forward EPS ($8.84) also suggests analysts anticipate a lower EPS in the near term compared to 2024 annual figures.
*   **Free Cash Flow Concern:** The TTM Free Cash Flow being negative ($-49.49 billion) is a notable concern, especially given the positive annual FCF figures up to 2024. This could signal higher capital expenditure, working capital changes, or a recent weakening of cash generation. A sustained negative FCF can pressure financial flexibility.
*   **Strong Balance Sheet:** Despite increasing debt, the Debt to Equity ratio remains healthy, and the Current Ratio indicates good short-term liquidity. The company maintains a substantial asset base.
*   **Capital Allocation:** The negative financing cash flow suggests the company is returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases (as indicated in cash flow data) or debt repayment. However, the significantly negative investing cash flow indicates continued substantial investments in the business.
*   **Market Valuation:** The TTM PE Ratio of 18.94 and Forward PE of 16.31 suggest the market expects some earnings growth, but the discrepancy in EPS figures needs to be reconciled to properly assess valuation. The Price to Book ratio of 2.21 indicates the stock is trading at more than twice its book value.
*   **Volatility:** A Beta of 0.39 suggests Alibaba's stock is less volatile than the broader market, which might appeal to risk-averse investors.

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: HOLD** - While Alibaba shows strong historical revenue and net income growth, and a healthy balance sheet, the significant discrepancy between the latest annual EPS and TTM EPS, combined with the negative TTM Free Cash Flow, introduces considerable uncertainty. Traders should hold and monitor these key metrics closely, awaiting further clarification or updated financial reports before making definitive buy or sell decisions. These specific data points require detailed analysis to understand if they represent a temporary blip or a more fundamental shift in the company's financial health.
